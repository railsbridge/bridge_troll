<h2>Sign up</h2>

<h3>Why do I need to sign up?</h3>
<p>Bridge Troll needs to send you a couple of emails: RSVP confirmations, upcoming workshop reminders, etc. We may also send you follow up surveys after the workshop to help us learn how to help you better.</p>

<div id="sign-up">
  <%= render 'form', button_text: 'Sign up', is_registered: false %>
	<%= render :partial => "devise/shared/links" %>
</div>
