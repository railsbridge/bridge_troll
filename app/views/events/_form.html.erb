          This sets be the maximum number of <strong>students</strong> you think could fit in your event.
          There is not a limit on the number of volunteer RSVPs, so you should consider
          the number of expected volunteers when determining student capacity. Most workshops
          have less than one volunteer for every student.

          <strong>
            After publishing, you can increase this, but not decrease it below the number of RSVP'd attendees.
