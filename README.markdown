# Bridge Troll
Â 
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/railsbridge/bridge_troll.png)](http://travis-ci.org/railsbridge/bridge_troll)

Bridge Troll is a Rails app that helps RailsBridge workshop organizers plan their events.

Bridge Troll aims to provide a single site for Students and Volunteers to register for workshops, so that Organizers have as much information as possible in one place to help them plan their workshop. Organizers will be able to easily contact attendees before a workshop, sort students and volunteers into classes on the workshop day, and provide follow-up surveys afterward.

Prospective organizers and attendees can sign up right now at [www.bridgetroll.org](http://www.bridgetroll.org). If you would really like roll your own, Bridge Troll is open source and you are free to fork, hack to your heart's content and deploy it to your favorite server or PaaS.

We have something of a roadmap [here](https://github.com/railsbridge/bridge_troll/wiki/Roadmap).

## Setting up for development

You'll need a version manager for Ruby.  We recommend [rvm](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com), but [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) will work.

### Quickstart

Note: change `git clone` below to be *your* repo.

```
git clone git@github.com:yourname/bridge_troll
cd bridge_troll
script/bootstrap
rails s
```

Go to http://localhost:3000/ and you can play with the app. (Pro-tip: to create a valid user without setting up email, run User.last.confirm! in the Rails console after signing up.)

### Running tests

You will need to install phantomjs for tests to run successfully. On OSX with Homebrew, try
```
brew update
brew install phantomjs
```

Then you can run tests by doing
```
script/test
```

### Seed Data

`rake db:seed` will create a sample event (called 'Seeded Test Event'), organized by a sample user, with many more sample user volunteers and students.

All the created users have easyish-to-remember logins, so a great way to test out organizer functionality is to load the seeds and log in as `organizer@example.com` with the password `password`.

Doing `rake db:seed` again will destroy all those sample persons and create the event again. The exact details of what is created can be found in `seed_event.rb`.

### Styling Guidelines
We have created a living style guide to keep track of HTML components and their styling across the site. See it at http://localhost:3000/style_guide.

We're still working on adding every element to the page, so if you see missing components, add it to the erb template ([static_pages/style_guide.html.erb](style_guide.html.erb))

### Email

To receive/develop emails locally, install the MailCatcher gem at http://mailcatcher.me. The process is as follows:

1. `gem install mailcatcher` -- installs MailCatcher in your current gemset
1. `mailcatcher` -- start the MailCatcher server if it isn't running already
1. Visit http://localhost:1080/ in your web browser. This is your MailCatcher mailbox, where mails will appear.
1. Do something in your local Bridge Troll app that would send a mail, like signing up for a new account.
1. You should see the mail that Rails sent in the MailCatcher window. Woo!

Note that MailCatcher just makes it easy to see the HTML output of your mails: it doesn't guarantee that the way the mail looks like in MailCatcher is how it will look in Gmail or Outlook. Beware!

### Meetup Integration

The following section is only necessary if you want to import Meetup data or work on Meetup OAuth features. The app will still work, and the tests will all pass, without setting any Meetup API keys.

#### Setting up environment

To populate environment variables, we recommend you start your rails server with **foreman**, which is available in the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/). Once foreman is installed, You'll need to create an `.env` file in the Bridge Troll directory for foreman to start effectively. Here's a sample one (note these are not real API keys):

```
MEETUP_API_KEY=12345
MEETUP_OAUTH_KEY=90210
MEETUP_OAUTH_SECRET=5551212
RAILS_ENV=development
RACK_ENV=development
PORT=3000
```

With the `.env` file in place, simply run `foreman start` in your Bridge Troll directory instead of starting with `rails server`.

#### Historical Meetup Importing
To import historical data from Meetup, use the rake task `rake meetup:import`. This requires you set up a MEETUP_API_KEY in your local environment, which you can find on Meetup at http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/.

#### Meetup OAuth
To test authenticating with Meetup using your localhost server, you need to [register a new OAuth Consumer at Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/oauth_consumers/).

When you add a new OAuth consumer, set the _Website_ as `http://bridgetroll.herokuapp.com`, the _Redirect URI_ as `http://localhost:3000/auth/meetup/callback`, and the _De-authorization Notification URL_ as `http://localhost:3000/auth/meetup/destroy`.

The values for _key_ and _secret_ on the OAuth consumers page should be added to your local environment as MEETUP_OAUTH_KEY and MEETUP_OAUTH_SECRET, respectively.
