If you're new to open source, check out our guide on [how to add features](https://github.com/railsbridge/bridge_troll/wiki/How-to-add-features).

#### Bugs
* If you see a bug in the code (or the running app), check the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/railsbridge/bridge_troll/issues) and comment on the issue if there is one.  If you know how to fix it, go for it! If you don't know how to fix it, please create a new issue. We're using GitHub issues for bug tracking and new features.

#### Testing
* Make sure you're writing tests. If you're new to TDD, come to a hack night and pair with someone who's experienced.
* We have awesome notes about from back when Women Who Code was building Bridge Troll. [Check them out](https://github.com/railsbridge/bridge_troll/wiki/2%2015%2012%20TDD%20Presentation%20by%20George). Courtesy the amazing [Judy Tuan](https://twitter.com/judytuna).
* Or, ask [the list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/bridge-troll)!
* Or, do the [Hartl tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book)!

#### Before submitting a pull request
* Tests. Run all the tests again, just to make sure you didn't break anything.
* You'll want to make sure your fork is totally up to date and squash + rebase your changes on top of it. We have [a Git guide](http://railsbridge.github.com/bridge_troll/) to help.

#### Non-coding ways to help
* Documentation. Help us figure out where our documentation can improve.
* Usability testing. What interactions are bad? Where did the app not do what you thought it would do?
