# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.

# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

#this seeds the database with an admin user--for development only
